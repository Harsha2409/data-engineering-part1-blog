##### Data Workflow:

Data Engineers are responsible for the first step of the Data Workflow process - ingesting collected data and storing it. They have a great responsibility as they lay the ground work for data analysts, data scientists and machine learning engineers. If the data is scattered around, corrupted, and difficult to access, there's not much to prepare, explore, or experiment with.
And that's exactly why you need a Data engineer: their job is to deliver the correct data, in the right form, to the right people, as efficiently as possible.
